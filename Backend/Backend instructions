V important:
	We didn't know how to import the database locally.
	So we just changed the prodcution database directly during testing.
	To do that, you need to have a MONGODB_URI variable in your bash script.
	To get that going, if you are using Sublime, type this into your terminal:
		subl ~/.bash_profile

	This should open your bash profile.
	Add this snippet to your script:
		MONGODB_URI="mongodb://pmd:pmd-server@ds161584.mlab.com:61584/heroku_kh1dfbl4"
		export MONGODB_URI

	Save the file, then run the script:
		source ~/.bash_profile

	Your environment variable should be all set and you can now connect to the production
	database!

Our database is set up using the mlab add-on on heroku
	heroku login:
		username: yu.yang@tufts.edu
		password: pmd-server

Not necesary but if you want to connect to your production database through your
terminal like mongod:
	Type this line to your terminal:
		mongo ds161584.mlab.com:61584/heroku_kh1dfbl4 -u pmd -p pmd-server
	commands like "show dbs" doesn't work unless you pay for mlab smh
